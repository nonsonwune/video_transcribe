 Here's a thought for you to treasure something for you to think about. Not everything you call a priority is really a priority. Now does that make sense to you? If what you call a priority is not moving your life forward, it's actually a selfish behavior. In that design, someone is going to get hurt. So does that make sense to you? Are you hurting anyone in your life right now? Oh, maybe it's you. Just something for you to think about.
